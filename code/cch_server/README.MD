# Server Description
This server was running on AWS EC2 micro freetier version, and only accept one IP address which is web-app IP address.
It can be divided into mainly two parts
1) Sending socket to Senet and vice-versa by using TCP server
2) Executing proper functions-related to db, application corresponding to requested API format

## HTTP server
```httpServer.js```
This is for part 1 - communication with app, using HTTP API request.

## TCP server
```tcpServer.js```
This is for part 2 - communication with Senet, using TCP socket.

## Installation
This is for the server installation, assuming that you are in cch_server folder.
```
$ cd server
$ npm install package.json
$ npm start app.js
```
By using 'pm2' library, it can be running on the background also for catching soket from senet periodically.
If you want to run this server even though you close the code interpreter, follow this steps:
```
$ cd server
$ npm install package.json
$ pm2 start app.js

//usefull commands
$ pm2 monit // shows monitoring page which has log screen, resource usage, and so on
$ pm2 stop  // stop running server
```

## development environment
```
